### Welcome to Irvingtech!

If you live in the Irvington neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, this service is for you. Never fear, tech help is here. Throughout the 2021 summer, I will be providing tech support for an affordable price in the neighborhood. This will help me make a bit of money before the school year starts again, and will hopefully help you with whatever issues you have currently. The service could be anything from just seeking advice on what to buy, having a problem with something, setting up a whole new home internet system, and much more. Basically, anything that has something to do with technology. Currently the service would start with a consultation (free of charge) where we would decide what the result of the service should be (what do you want me to finish). The second part would be fixing the problem. During this time of uncertainty, if possible, I would prefer to troubleshoot over zoom, but if need be, I can go around the neighborhood.

## Pricing

Again starting with free consulations, the flat rate would be $20 for 1 1/2 hours, and then $10 an hour past that. I am willing to discuss pricing rates should that need to be revised. Payment will for now be through cash or my parents PayPal.

## Getting the service

Contact me at ethan.hargunani@outlook.com or by text at (503)348-3480 and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
