### Welcome to Irvingtech!

If you live in the Irvington neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, this service is for you. Never fear, tech help is here! Throughout the 2021 summer, I will be offering tech support for an affordable price in the neighborhood. This will help me make a bit of money before the school year starts again, and will hopefully help you with whatever tech issues you have. The service could be anything from just seeking advice on what to buy, having a problem with something, setting up a new home internet system, and much more. Basically, anything that has something to do with technology. Currently the service would start with a consultation (free of charge) where we would decide what type of the service would be necessary. The second part would be solving the problem. I would prefer to troubleshoot over Zoom, but if need be, I can go around the neighborhood.

## Pricing

After a free consulation, I charge a flat rate of $20 for 1 1/2 hours, and then $10 an hour past that. I am willing to discuss pricing rates should that need to be revised. Payment will for now be through cash, PayPal or Venmo.

## Getting the service
